This is a little Beta version of something I use for
making albums.  It's intended to be run just directly
on a bunch of file names like: album.pl new_stuff/*.jpg

Installation: 
make test
make install

copy the album.pl to somewhere in your path.

notes:

It does create a directory containing thumbnails
in $HOME.  When you press the store button it gives
the path it's using.

To re-edit a gallery you can start album with 
album.pl -D path_to_dir

You can actually move that directory, but you cannot
move the images you gave it in the begining if you want to
re-edit the data.
